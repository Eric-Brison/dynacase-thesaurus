Introduction
------------

pam_what_access aims to provide a backend neutral means of authenticating
users against an SQL database.  The author uses PostgreSQL, but
there's also some mysql code leftover from the pam_mysql project
(whence this project evolved) that I'm quite sure doesn't work.


Installation
------------

0) unpack the tarball

1) edit the makefiles
   At the very least, make sure that "prefix" is set correctly in
   config.mk

2) run "make"
   
3) su -c "make install"

I'd like to think that pam_what_access will compile out of the box on
anybody's machine, but that's probably not true.  You may have to do
some tweaking in Makefile (or even [gasp!] the source) to get pam_what_access
to compile on your machine.  If you do have to change something, I'd
love a patch.


Configuration
-------------

Once you've got pam_what_access compiled and installed, you can use it.  There
are a number of options you need to give in your pam.conf file, though
in order for pam_what_access to be useful to you:

host, port
  the hostname and port where the database server is running. if you
  don't set this option, pam_what_access will connect using UNIX domain
  sockets.

dbname
  the name of the database to connect to.

dbuser, dbpass
  the username and password to use for authentication to the database

application
  the WHAT application name

access
  the minimum access needed for the WHAT application
  
  


An example entry:

auth    required        /lib/security/pam_what_access.so dbname=users dbuser=root dbpass=password application=MAIL access=IMAP
